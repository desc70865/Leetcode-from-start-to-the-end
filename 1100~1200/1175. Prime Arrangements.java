/* 
Return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
Example 2:

Input: n = 100
Output: 682289015
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100

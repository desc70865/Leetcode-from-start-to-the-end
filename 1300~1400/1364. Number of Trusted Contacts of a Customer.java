Write an SQL query to find the following for each invoice_id:

customer_name: The name of the customer the invoice is related to.
price: The price of the invoice.
contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer.
trusted_contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer and at the same time they are customers to the shop. (i.e His/Her email exists in the Customers table.)
Order the result table by invoice_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

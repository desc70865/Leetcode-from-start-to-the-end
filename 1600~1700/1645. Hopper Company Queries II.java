Write an SQL query to report the percentage of working drivers (working_percentage) for each month of 2020 where:


Note that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the working_percentage to be 0.

Return the result table ordered by month in ascending order, where month is the month's number (January is 1, February is 2, etc.). Round working_percentage to the nearest 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example.
